I built this because AI coding agents burn through tokens fast on tasks any decent model handles fine — generating boilerplate, code review, commit messages, format conversion. Stuff that doesn't need frontier-model reasoning or tool access.

Houtini LM connects your orchestrator (Claude Code, Codex CLI, whatever MCP client you run) to a sidekick LLM — a local model on your network, or any OpenAI-compatible API. Your orchestrator keeps architecture, planning, decisions, and verification, while the sidekick handles bounded execution. The strongest context savings come from path-based delegation, where source files go directly to the sidekick instead of first entering the orchestrator context.

I wrote a [full walkthrough of why I built this and how I use it day to day](https://houtini.com/how-to-cut-your-claude-code-bill-with-houtini-lm/).

## How it works

```
Your MCP Client (Claude Code / Codex CLI / VS Code)
   |
   |-- Complex reasoning, planning, architecture --> Primary API (your tokens)
   |
   +-- Bounded grunt work --> houtini-lm --HTTP/SSE--> Your sidekick LLM (cheap/free)
       . Boilerplate & test stubs          Qwen, Llama, Nemotron, GLM...
       . Code review & explanations        LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp
       . Commit messages & docs            DeepSeek, Groq, Cerebras (cloud)
       . Format conversion
       . Mock data & type definitions
       . Embeddings for RAG pipelines
```

Your orchestrator's the architect. Your sidekick model's the drafter. Review everything.

## Quick start

> New to local models? See **[docs/GETTING-STARTED.md](./docs/GETTING-STARTED.md)** — installing LM Studio or a Docker endpoint, getting an OpenAI-compatible URL for houtini, what the smaller models are good at, and which models fit on 16/32/64/96/128 GB of VRAM.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add houtini-lm -- npx -y @houtini/lm
```

That's it. If LM Studio's running on `localhost:1234` (the default), your orchestrator can start delegating straight away.

### Codex CLI

```bash
codex mcp add houtini-lm -- npx -y @houtini/lm
```

Works the same way as Claude Code. Point it at DeepSeek or any other OpenAI-compatible API:

```bash
codex mcp add houtini-lm \
  --env HOUTINI_LM_ENDPOINT_URL=https://api.deepseek.com \
  --env HOUTINI_LM_API_KEY=sk-your-deepseek-key \
  --env HOUTINI_LM_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash \
  --env HOUTINI_LM_ORCHESTRATOR=codex \
  -- npx -y @houtini/lm
```

### VS Code Codex

Add to `~/.codex/config.toml` (shared between the Codex CLI and VS Code extension):

```toml
[mcp_servers.houtini-lm]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@houtini/lm"]
tool_timeout_sec = 120
enabled_tools = ["delegate"]
# Forward this from the environment instead of storing the key in TOML:
env_vars = ["HOUTINI_LM_API_KEY"]

[mcp_servers.houtini-lm.env]
HOUTINI_LM_ENDPOINT_URL = "https://api.deepseek.com"
HOUTINI_LM_PROVIDER = "deepseek"
HOUTINI_LM_MODEL = "deepseek-v4-flash"
HOUTINI_LM_ORCHESTRATOR = "codex"
HOUTINI_LM_DEEPSEEK_THINKING = "disabled"
HOUTINI_LM_AUTO_MAX_TOKENS = "1800"
HOUTINI_LM_RESPONSE_METADATA = "none"
# Windows example; set this to the projects the MCP may read:
HOUTINI_LM_ALLOWED_ROOTS = "D:\\projects"
```

> **Codex timeout note**: The default `tool_timeout_sec` in Codex is 60s. If using slower local models, raise it in `~/.codex/config.toml`:
> ```toml
> [mcp_servers.houtini-lm]
> tool_timeout_sec = 300
> ```

### LLM on a different machine

I've got a GPU box on my local network running Qwen 3 Coder Next in LM Studio. If you've got a similar setup, point the URL at it:

```bash
claude mcp add houtini-lm -e HOUTINI_LM_ENDPOINT_URL=http://192.168.1.50:1234 -- npx -y @houtini/lm
```

### Cloud APIs

Works with anything speaking the OpenAI format. DeepSeek at twenty-eight cents per million tokens, Groq for speed, Cerebras if you want three thousand tokens per second - whatever you fancy:

```bash
claude mcp add houtini-lm \
  -e HOUTINI_LM_ENDPOINT_URL=https://api.deepseek.com \
  -e HOUTINI_LM_API_KEY=your-key-here \
  -- npx -y @houtini/lm
```

### OpenRouter

OpenRouter gives you 300+ models through one endpoint. Auto-detected from the URL — attribution headers, `reasoning.exclude`, and retry-with-backoff all kick in automatically:

```bash
claude mcp add houtini-lm \
  -e HOUTINI_LM_ENDPOINT_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api \
  -e HOUTINI_LM_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-... \
  -e HOUTINI_LM_MODEL=nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free \
  -- npx -y @houtini/lm
```

### Claude Desktop

Drop this into your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "houtini-lm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@houtini/lm"],
      "env": {
        "HOUTINI_LM_ENDPOINT_URL": "http://localhost:1234"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Model discovery

This is where things get interesting. At startup, houtini-lm queries your LLM server for every model available - loaded and downloaded - then looks each one up on HuggingFace's free API to pull metadata: architecture, licence, download count, pipeline type. All of that gets cached in a local SQLite database (`~/.houtini-lm/model-cache.db`) so subsequent startups are instant.

The result is that houtini-lm actually knows what your models are good at. Not just the name - the capabilities, the strengths, what tasks to send where. If you've got Nemotron loaded but a Qwen Coder sitting idle, it'll flag that. If someone on a completely different setup loads a Mistral model houtini-lm has never seen before, the HuggingFace lookup auto-generates a profile for it.

Run `list_models` and you get the full picture:

```
Loaded models (ready to use):

  nvidia/nemotron-3-nano
    type: llm, arch: nemotron_h_moe, quant: Q4_K_M, format: gguf
    context: 200,082 (max 1,048,576), by: nvidia
    Capabilities: tool_use
    NVIDIA Nemotron: compact reasoning model optimised for step-by-step logic
    Best for: analysis tasks, code bug-finding, math/science questions
    HuggingFace: text-generation, 1.7M downloads, MIT licence

Available models (downloaded, not loaded):

  qwen3-coder-30b-a3b-instruct
    type: llm, arch: qwen3moe, quant: BF16, context: 262,144
    Qwen3 Coder: code-specialised model with agentic capabilities
    Best for: code generation, code review, test stubs, refactoring
    HuggingFace: text-generation, 12.9K downloads, Apache-2.0
```

For models we know well - Qwen, Nemotron, Granite, LLaMA, GLM, GPT-OSS - there's a curated profile built in with specific strengths and weaknesses. For everything else, the HuggingFace lookup fills the gaps. Cache refreshes every 7 days. Zero friction - the cache uses `node:sqlite` (Node's built-in SQLite, so no third-party native dependency and no build tools) in WAL mode, which lets several houtini-lm processes share one cache safely. Requires Node ≥ 22.5.

## What gets offloaded

**Delegate to the local model** - bounded, well-defined tasks:

| Task | Why it works locally |
|------|---------------------|
| Generate test stubs | Clear input (source), clear output (tests) |
| Explain a function | Summarisation doesn't need tool access |
| Draft commit messages | Diff in, message out |
| Code review | Paste full source, ask for bugs |
| Convert formats | JSON to YAML, snake_case to camelCase |
| Generate mock data | Schema in, data out |
| Write type definitions | Source in, types out |
| Structured JSON output | Grammar-constrained, guaranteed valid |
| Text embeddings | Semantic search, RAG pipelines |
| Brainstorm approaches | Doesn't commit to anything |

**Keep on the primary/orchestrator model** - anything that needs reasoning, tool access, or multi-step orchestration:

- Architectural decisions
- Reading/writing files
- Running tests and interpreting results
- Multi-file refactoring plans
- Anything that needs to call other tools

The tool descriptions are written to nudge the orchestrator into planning delegation at the start of large tasks, not just using it when it happens to think of it.

## Performance tracking

Every response includes a footer with real performance data — computed from the SSE stream, not from any proprietary API:

```
---
Model: nvidia/nemotron-3-nano | 279→303 tokens (12 reasoning / 291 visible) | TTFT: 485ms, 58.0 tok/s, 5.2s
📊 First measured call on nvidia/nemotron-3-nano: 58.0 tok/s, 485ms to first token — use this to gauge whether to delegate longer tasks.
🤖 Sidekick tokens processed — this session: 4,283 tokens / 7 calls · lifetime: 147,432 tokens / 213 calls
```

The 📊 line only appears on the first measured call per model per session — it's a real benchmark from a genuine task, not a synthetic warmup. The 💰 line updates every call.

When the active model returns `completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` (DeepSeek R1, LM Studio with "Separate reasoning_content" enabled, OpenAI reasoning models), the token block splits into `reasoning / visible` so you can see when a thinking model is burning its output budget on hidden reasoning.

### Lifetime persistence

Per-model performance and token counts persist across orchestrator restarts in `~/.houtini-lm/model-cache.db`. This means:

- From call 1 of a new session, `discover` shows **historical** tok/s and TTFT for the loaded model — not "not yet benchmarked".
- The 💰 counter shows both session and lifetime totals.
- The `code_task_files` pre-flight estimator uses measured per-model prefill rate to refuse obviously-too-large inputs with a clear diagnostic, instead of letting them silently hang against the MCP client timeout.

The data is workstation-specific — that's intentional. Routing decisions should reflect your actual hardware, not a synthetic benchmark.

The `discover` tool shows per-model averages across both scopes:

```
Measured speed (session):  58.0 tok/s · TTFT 485ms (1 call)
Measured speed (lifetime on this workstation): 46.9 tok/s · TTFT 2641ms (214 calls, last used 2026-04-20)
```

In practice, the orchestrator delegates more aggressively the longer a session runs. After about 5,000 offloaded tokens, it starts hunting for more work to push over. Reinforcing loop.

## Model routing

If you've got multiple models loaded (or downloaded), houtini-lm picks the best one for each task automatically. Each model family has per-family prompt hints - temperature, output constraints, and think-block flags - so GLM gets told "no preamble, no step-by-step reasoning" while Qwen Coder gets a low temperature for focused code output.

The routing scores loaded models against the task type (code, chat, analysis, embedding). If the best loaded model isn't ideal for the task, you'll see a suggestion in the response footer pointing to a better downloaded model. No runtime model swapping - model loading takes minutes, so houtini-lm suggests rather than blocks.

Supported model families with curated prompt hints: GLM-4, Qwen3 Coder, Qwen3, LLaMA 3, Nemotron, Granite, GPT-OSS, Nomic Embed. Unknown models get sensible defaults.

### Overriding the router

Scoring works well when there are a handful of loaded models. On providers with large catalogues (OpenRouter lists 300+ models, all reporting as routable) unknown models all score zero and ties break on iteration order, so you probably want to pin explicitly. Two ways, in precedence order:

1. **Per-call** — pass `model: "nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free"` to any of `chat` / `custom_prompt` / `code_task` / `code_task_files`. Overrides everything else.
2. **Per-process** — set `HOUTINI_LM_MODEL` in the environment. Applies to every tool call from that server process. Overridden by the per-call parameter.

Leave both unset and the router picks.

## Tools

### `delegate` (recommended for Codex)

Codex mode exposes one compact tool instead of the full legacy tool set. Codex decides what work is bounded, while the sidekick executes large-file first-pass review/summary, extraction, conversion, boilerplate, and drafts. Pass absolute `paths` whenever possible so file contents go directly to DeepSeek without first entering Codex context. DeepSeek thinking follows `HOUTINI_LM_DEEPSEEK_THINKING` and can be overridden per call; Codex still retains final decisions, edits, and verification.

For DeepSeek thinking calls, `max_tokens` is treated as the desired visible
answer budget. Houtini-LM adds a bounded hidden-reasoning allowance internally.
If the model still returns reasoning only or hits the completion limit before a
complete answer, the request is retried once with thinking disabled. Optional
`max_chars` triggers a final thinking-disabled compression pass.

`output_path` can write the final visible result beneath
`HOUTINI_LM_ALLOWED_ROOTS`, returning only a short path/hash receipt to Codex.
Its parent directory must already exist, and existing files require
`overwrite: true`. This is bounded artifact output, not arbitrary file or
command access; Houtini-LM still cannot execute shell commands.

| Parameter | Required | Default | What it does |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `task` | yes | - | Concrete bounded task and exact requested output. |
| `paths` | no | - | Absolute file paths read by the MCP without entering Codex context. |
| `model` | no | configured model | Optional per-call model override. |
| `content` | no | - | Inline input when paths are not appropriate. |
| `kind` | no | inferred | Output/budget hint: convert, extract, explain, summarize, review, draft, or general. |
| `language` | no | - | Optional programming-language hint. |
| `max_tokens` | no | *task budget* | Bounded by the task default and `HOUTINI_LM_AUTO_MAX_TOKENS`. |
| `max_chars` | no | - | Visible character target; oversized answers receive a compression pass. |
| `thinking` | no | environment | Per-call DeepSeek mode: `disabled`, `enabled`, or `auto`. |
| `output_path` | no | - | Absolute output file beneath an allowed root; returns a compact receipt. |
| `overwrite` | no | `false` | Permit replacing an existing `output_path`. |

### `chat`

The workhorse. Send a task, get an answer. The description includes planning triggers that nudge the orchestrator to identify offloadable work when it's starting a big task.

| Parameter | Required | Default | What it does |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `message` | yes | - | The task. Be specific about output format. |
| `system` | no | - | Persona - "Senior TypeScript dev" not "helpful assistant" |
| `temperature` | no | 0.3 | 0.1 for code, 0.3 for analysis, 0.7 for creative |
| `max_tokens` | no | *task budget* | Bounded by the task default and `HOUTINI_LM_AUTO_MAX_TOKENS`. |
| `json_schema` | no | - | Request valid JSON with the schema as guidance; provider-level conformance varies. |
| `model` | no | *auto-route* | Pin a specific model id (e.g. `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free` on OpenRouter). Overrides routing and `HOUTINI_LM_MODEL`. Useful on providers with many candidates. |

### `custom_prompt`

Three-part prompt: system, context, instruction. Keeping them separate prevents context bleed - consistently outperforms stuffing everything into one message, especially with local models. I tested this properly one weekend - took the same batch of review tasks and ran them both ways. Splitting things into three parts won every round.

| Parameter | Required | Default | What it does |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `instruction` | yes | - | What to produce. Under 50 words works best. |
| `system` | no | - | Persona + constraints, under 30 words |
| `context` | no | - | Complete data to analyse. Never truncate. |
| `temperature` | no | 0.3 | 0.1 for review, 0.3 for analysis |
| `max_tokens` | no | *task budget* | Bounded by the task default and `HOUTINI_LM_AUTO_MAX_TOKENS`. |
| `json_schema` | no | - | Force structured JSON output |
| `model` | no | *auto-route* | Pin a specific model id. Overrides routing and `HOUTINI_LM_MODEL`. |

### `code_task`

Built for code analysis. Pre-configured system prompt with temperature and output constraints tuned per model family via the routing layer.

| Parameter | Required | Default | What it does |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `code` | yes | - | Complete source code. Never truncate. |
| `task` | yes | - | "Find bugs", "Explain this", "Write tests" |
| `language` | no | - | "typescript", "python", "rust", etc. |
| `max_tokens` | no | *task budget* | Bounded by the task default and `HOUTINI_LM_AUTO_MAX_TOKENS`. |
| `model` | no | *auto-route* | Pin a specific model id. Overrides routing and `HOUTINI_LM_MODEL`. |

### `code_task_files`

Like `code_task`, but the local LLM reads files directly from disk — source never passes through the MCP client's context window. Use this when reviewing multiple related files, or a single large file that's awkward to paste. Files are read in parallel with `Promise.allSettled`, so one unreadable file doesn't sink the call; failures are surfaced inline with the reason.

Includes a **pre-flight prefill estimator**: if measured per-model data from the SQLite cache shows the input would exceed the MCP client's ~60s request-timeout during prompt processing, the call is refused early with a concrete diagnostic (estimated prefill seconds, tokens, and sample-count) instead of letting it silently hang. First-time callers are never refused — the estimator only fires after ≥2 measured samples.

| Parameter | Required | Default | What it does |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `paths` | yes | - | Array of absolute file paths. Relative paths are rejected. |
| `task` | yes | - | "Find bugs across these files", "Audit this module" |
| `language` | no | - | "typescript", "python", "rust", etc. |
| `max_tokens` | no | *task budget* | Bounded by the task default and `HOUTINI_LM_AUTO_MAX_TOKENS`. |
| `model` | no | *auto-route* | Pin a specific model id. Overrides routing and `HOUTINI_LM_MODEL`. |

### `embed`

Generate text embeddings via the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` endpoint. Requires an embedding model to be available - Nomic Embed is a solid choice. Returns the vector, dimension count, and usage stats.

| Parameter | Required | Default | What it does |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `input` | yes | - | Text to embed |
| `model` | no | auto | Embedding model ID |

### `discover`

Health check and speed readout. Returns model name, context window, capability profile, connection latency (labelled explicitly — this is the `/v1/models` fetch round-trip, *not* inference speed), and the active model's measured tok/s and TTFT averaged over the session. Before any real call has run, measured speed shows as "not yet benchmarked — will be captured on the first real call" rather than inventing a number from a synthetic probe. Call before delegating if you're not sure the LLM's available, or when deciding whether a longer task is worth offloading.

### `list_models`

Lists everything on the LLM server - loaded and downloaded - with full metadata: architecture, quantisation, context window, capabilities, and HuggingFace enrichment data. Shows capability profiles describing what each model is best at, so the orchestrator can make informed delegation decisions.

### `stats`

Compact markdown dump of your offload stats — session and lifetime totals, per-model performance history, reasoning-token overhead — without the model catalog that `discover` prints. Cheap to call repeatedly to watch the 💰 counter climb.

| Parameter | Required | Default | What it does |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | no | - | Filter output to a single model ID. Omit for all models ever used on this workstation. |

Example output:

```
## Houtini LM stats
**Endpoint**: http://gpu-box:1234 (LM Studio)
**First call on this workstation**: 2026-04-14

### Totals
| Scope    | Calls | Prompt tokens | Completion tokens | Total tokens |
| Session  |     7 |         3,100 |             1,183 |        4,283 |
| Lifetime |   213 |             — |                 — |      147,432 |

### Per-model performance
| Model                    | Scope    | Calls | Avg TTFT | Avg tok/s | Prompt tokens | Last used  |
| nvidia/nemotron-3-nano   | session  |     7 |    485   |      58.0 | —             | —          |
| nvidia/nemotron-3-nano   | lifetime |   213 |   2641   |      46.9 |       89,320  | 2026-04-20 |

### Reasoning-token overhead (lifetime)
124 / 47,183 completion tokens spent on hidden reasoning (0.3%). Low — reasoning is effectively suppressed.
```

The reasoning-token overhead line is the canary for "is `reasoning_effort` actually being honoured on this model and this backend?" — above ~30% is a signal to investigate.

## Structured JSON output

Both `chat` and `custom_prompt` accept a `json_schema` parameter that forces the response to conform to a JSON Schema. LM Studio uses grammar-based sampling to guarantee valid output - no hoping the model remembers to close its brackets.

```json
{
  "json_schema": {
    "name": "code_review",
    "schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "issues": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "line": { "type": "number" },
              "severity": { "type": "string" },
              "description": { "type": "string" }
            },
            "required": ["line", "severity", "description"]
          }
        }
      },
      "required": ["issues"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Getting good results from local models

Qwen, Llama, Nemotron, GLM - they score brilliantly on coding benchmarks now. The gap between a good and bad result is almost always prompt quality, not model capability. I've spent a fair bit of time on this.

**Send complete code.** Local models hallucinate details when you give them truncated input. If a file's too large, send the relevant function - not a snippet with `...` in the middle.

**Be explicit about output format.** "Return a JSON array" or "respond in bullet points" - don't leave it open-ended. Smaller models need this.

**Set a specific persona.** "Expert Rust developer who cares about memory safety" gets noticeably better results than "helpful assistant."

**State constraints.** "No preamble", "reference line numbers", "max 5 bullet points" - tell the model what *not* to do as well as what to do.

**Include surrounding context.** For code generation, send imports, types, and function signatures - not just the function body.

**One call at a time.** As of v2.8.0, houtini-lm enforces this automatically with a request semaphore. Parallel calls queue up and run one at a time, so each gets the full timeout budget instead of stacking.

## Self-test (shakedown)

The canonical way to verify an install and get an honest read on what the loaded model can do on your hardware:

```bash
npm run shakedown
```

This runs [`shakedown.mjs`](./shakedown.mjs) — an end-to-end test that exercises seven of the eight tools (`discover` → `list_models` → `chat` → `custom_prompt` → `code_task` → `code_task_files` → `embed`; `stats` is not covered) and prints a summary table with real TTFT, tok/s, token counts, and reasoning-token split for each call. Takes under a minute on a decent rig.

Sample output tail:

```
Summary

```

Want a human-readable quality review rather than just latency numbers? Paste [SHAKEDOWN.md](./SHAKEDOWN.md) into an orchestrator session that has houtini-lm attached — the orchestrator will drive the seven steps and write you a report on output quality as well as performance.

## Think-block handling

Thinking models burn part of their output budget on invisible reasoning before producing an answer. Left alone, small models at default `max_tokens` will happily spend the whole budget reasoning and return an empty body. How houtini-lm handles this depends on whether the provider exposes reasoning as a separate channel or in-band.

**Local backends (LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM)** — reasoning arrives inline on the content channel or via `delta.reasoning_content` / `delta.reasoning`:

1. **Suppression at source** — at startup, houtini-lm checks each model's HuggingFace chat template for thinking support. Models that support the `enable_thinking` toggle (Qwen3, Gemma 4, Nemotron, DeepSeek R1, GLM-4, gpt-oss) get thinking disabled at inference time. Detection is automatic via chat-template inspection plus arch/id heuristics, so Ollama tags like `qwen3:4b` are recognised too.
2. **Budget inflation** — `max_tokens` is silently inflated (×4 or +2000, whichever is bigger) so reasoning can't starve the content channel. Essential for backends like Ollama where the Qwen3 Jinja template hardcodes `enable_thinking=true` and ignores the API flag.
3. **Reasoning capture + stripping** — reasoning is captured from both `delta.reasoning_content` (LM Studio, DeepSeek R1, Nemotron) and `delta.reasoning` (Ollama). Inline `<think>...</think>` blocks on the content channel are stripped after assembly — balanced pairs, orphan openers, and orphan closers are all handled. When reasoning exhausts the budget entirely, the captured reasoning text is returned as a last-ditch fallback so the caller sees *something* rather than a silent empty body.

**OpenRouter** — handles reasoning as a structured per-request parameter and a separate `message.reasoning` response field. Houtini-lm sends `reasoning: { exclude: true }` on every OpenRouter call so thinking models (Nemotron, DeepSeek R1, Qwen3, Claude thinking, gpt-oss, etc.) are normalised to text-only output at the provider level. Budget inflation still fires because some upstream providers bill reasoning tokens against the cap before `exclude` filtering. No stripping is needed — the provider never sends the reasoning in the first place.

The quality footer flags `think-blocks-stripped` when stripping occurred, `reasoning-only` when the fallback fired, and `hit-max-tokens` when the budget ran out — so you know exactly what happened even when the output looks clean.

## Quality metadata

Every response includes structured quality signals in the footer so the orchestrator can make informed trust decisions:

```
---
Model: qwen3-coder-30b-a3b | 413→81 tokens | TTFT: 2355ms, 15.0 tok/s, 5.4s | Quality: think-blocks-stripped, tokens-estimated
🤖 Sidekick tokens processed this session: 494 tokens across 1 offloaded call
```

Flags include: `TRUNCATED` (partial result), `think-blocks-stripped`, `tokens-estimated` (usage data was missing, estimated from content length), `hit-max-tokens`. When no flags fire, the quality line is omitted — clean output, nothing to report.

## Session metrics resource

The `houtini://metrics/session` MCP resource exposes cumulative offload stats as JSON. The orchestrator can read this proactively to make smarter delegation decisions based on actual session performance:

```json
{
  "session": {
    "totalCalls": 14,
    "promptTokens": 3200,
    "completionTokens": 5250,
    "totalTokensOffloaded": 8450
  },
  "perModel": {
    "qwen3-coder-30b-a3b": {
      "calls": 14,
      "avgTtftMs": 2100,
      "avgTokPerSec": 15.2
    }
  }
}
```

## Request serialisation

On **local** providers (LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp) parallel MCP tool calls are automatically queued and run one at a time. A single-GPU host can only serve one request at a time anyway — without the semaphore, parallel calls stack timeouts and waste the generation budget.

On recognised **remote** providers (currently OpenRouter and DeepSeek) the semaphore is skipped — the upstream handles parallelism natively and serialising artificially would throttle it.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `HOUTINI_LM_ENDPOINT_URL` | `http://localhost:1234` | Base URL of the OpenAI-compatible API. Legacy alias: `LM_STUDIO_URL`. |
| `HOUTINI_LM_API_KEY` | *(none)* | Bearer token for authenticated endpoints. `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` and legacy aliases are also accepted. |
| `HOUTINI_LM_MODEL` | *(auto-detect)* | Model identifier — leave blank to use whatever's loaded. Legacy alias: `LM_STUDIO_MODEL`. |
| `HOUTINI_LM_PROVIDER` | *(auto-detect)* | Force provider-specific handling. Set to `openrouter` for OpenRouter attribution headers, `reasoning.exclude`, and no inference serialisation. Otherwise auto-detected from the endpoint URL. |
| `HOUTINI_LM_CONTEXT_WINDOW` | `100000` | Fallback context window if the API doesn't report it. Legacy alias: `LM_CONTEXT_WINDOW`. |
| `HOUTINI_LM_ORCHESTRATOR` | *(generic)* | Set `codex` to expose only the compact `delegate` tool and Codex-specific delegation guidance. |
| `HOUTINI_LM_DEEPSEEK_THINKING` | `disabled` | Default DeepSeek request mode: `disabled`, `enabled`, or `auto`. `delegate` can override it per call. |
| `HOUTINI_LM_AUTO_MAX_TOKENS` | `4096` | Hard ceiling for automatically selected and caller-requested output budgets. |
| `HOUTINI_LM_MAX_INPUT_CHARS` | `400000` | Hard input-size ceiling for one Codex `delegate` call. |
| `HOUTINI_LM_RESPONSE_METADATA` | `compact` for Codex, otherwise `full` | Footer mode: `none`, `compact`, or `full`. `delegate` returns no footer. |
| `HOUTINI_LM_ALLOWED_ROOTS` | *(unrestricted)* | Comma-separated directories allowed for path-based delegation. Real paths are checked to block symlink, junction, traversal, and cross-drive escapes. |

## Compatible endpoints

Works with anything that speaks the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` API:

| What | URL | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) | `http://localhost:1234` | Default, zero config. Rich metadata via v0 API. |
| [Ollama](https://ollama.com) | `http://localhost:11434` | Set `HOUTINI_LM_ENDPOINT_URL`. Thinking models (qwen3, deepseek-r1) handled transparently — reasoning is captured from Ollama's `delta.reasoning` channel and the output budget is inflated automatically so small thinking models don't return empty bodies. |
| [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) | `https://openrouter.ai/api` | 300+ models from one endpoint. Auto-detected — sends attribution headers, uses `reasoning.exclude` for thinking models, retries 429/5xx with jittered backoff, parallel requests allowed. |
| [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai) | `http://localhost:8000` | Native OpenAI API |
| [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) | `http://localhost:8080` | Server mode |
| [DeepSeek](https://platform.deepseek.com) | `https://api.deepseek.com` | 28c/M input tokens |
| [Groq](https://groq.com) | `https://api.groq.com/openai` | ~750 tok/s |
| [Cerebras](https://cerebras.ai) | `https://api.cerebras.ai` | ~3000 tok/s |
| Any OpenAI-compatible API | Any URL | Set URL + password |

## Streaming and timeouts

All inference uses Server-Sent Events streaming. Tokens arrive incrementally. Since v2.9.0, houtini-lm sends MCP progress notifications on every streamed chunk — including during the thinking phase for reasoning models — which resets the SDK's 60-second client timeout. A 5-minute soft timeout acts as a safety net so a genuinely wedged connection can't hold a tool call open indefinitely; as long as tokens keep flowing, the per-chunk progress keeps the client side alive up to that ceiling.

If the connection stalls (no new tokens for an extended period), you get a partial result instead of a timeout error. The footer shows `TRUNCATED` when this happens, and the quality metadata flags it so the orchestrator knows to treat the output with appropriate caution.

## Architecture

```
index.ts          Main MCP server - tools, streaming, session tracking
model-cache.ts    SQLite-backed model profile cache (node:sqlite, WAL)
                  Auto-profiles models via HuggingFace API at startup
                  Persists to ~/.houtini-lm/model-cache.db

Inference:        POST /v1/chat/completions  (OpenAI-compatible, works everywhere)
Model metadata:   GET  /api/v0/models        (LM Studio, falls back to /v1/models)
Embeddings:       POST /v1/embeddings        (OpenAI-compatible)
```

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/houtini-ai/lm.git
cd lm
npm install
npm run build
npm run shakedown    # end-to-end self-test + benchmark
```
